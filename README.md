## Important Note

This README is just a small summary of the problem and context around it, for the full write up with much more detail please refer to the link below or click [here](https://patricksyoussef.github.io/ML-HAR/).

## Problem

As part of the MAE 195 Intro to Machine Learning course at UCI, we were tasked with creating a classifier for a common HAR data set. The task was not just to create the classifier, but attempt to understand the shortcomings of the data set and models in getting to perfect classification.

## First Machine Learning Project

This project, and the class in general, was my first exposure into the world of machine learning. Since then I've have a wonderful time learning more and I hope to soon have more projects on this GitHub about them but this is a great place to see where I started in the few weeks that I got that exposure.
